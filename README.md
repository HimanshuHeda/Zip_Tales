## Credibility Badges & Source Reliability (New)

Enhance reader trust with a source credibility badge on each article card. The badge is color-coded by reliability and includes an interactive modal with a legend and quick reporting link.

### What‚Äôs Included

- **Source credibility badge on article cards**: Indicates the reliability of the source.
- **Color thresholds**: Green (‚â•80), Yellow (50‚Äì79), Red (<50), Gray (Not Rated).
- **Tooltip**: ‚ÄúThis score is based on the reliability rating of the source.‚Äù
- **Interactive modal**: Legend, source domain, and a ‚ÄúReport this source‚Äù link.
- **Prefilled Contact**: Reporting link prepopulates the contact form via query params.

### Files Added/Edited

- Added: `src/components/SourceCredibilityBadge.tsx`
- Added: `src/data/sourceReliability.json`
- Edited: `src/components/NewsCard.tsx` (integrated the badge)
- Edited: `src/pages/Contact.tsx` (prefill type/subject/message from URL)
- Edited: `src/lib/credibility.ts` (implemented `lookupSourceReliability` with URL/name handling)

### How It Works

- `NewsCard` renders `SourceCredibilityBadge` using `article.source`.
- The badge extracts the domain (supports full URLs and raw names) and looks up a score in `src/data/sourceReliability.json`.
- Click the badge to open a small modal with a legend and a reporting link.
- The reporting link routes to `/contact` with query parameters that prefill the form.

### Configure Source Scores

- Update `src/data/sourceReliability.json` to add or modify source scores.
- Keys should be domains (preferred), e.g. `"bbc.com"`. Bare names can also be used if needed.

Example:

```json
{
  "bbc.com": 90,
  "cnn.com": 85,
  "unknownsource.xyz": 40
}
```

### Contact Page Prefill

`/contact?type=report&subject=Report%20source%3A%20bbc.com&message=I%20would%20like%20to%20report...`

- Recognized query params: `type`, `subject`, `message`.
- `type=report` selects the ‚ÄúReport Misinformation‚Äù category automatically.

### Future Enhancements

- Fetch reliability from external services (e.g., NewsGuard, MBFC) instead of static JSON.
- Allow users to propose rating changes and view rationale.
- Add a detailed breakdown modal per source.
